# Distributed-Server-Client-Communication
AESL recruitment Assignment -1
Build a distributed setting where you need to manage the underlying communications between nodes. The assignment requires you to verify correctness by ensuring that: (1) the number of messages that you send
and receive within the system match, and (2) these messages have not been corrupted in transit to the intended recipient. Message exchanges in the system will be done in the presence of rapid setup/teardown of connections and while a connection is alive.
